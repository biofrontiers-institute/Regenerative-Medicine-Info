                        <h3>Importance</h3>
                        <p>Regenerative medicine is an area of great need as well as intense growth. There is strong investment potential in the research sector (for example, the recent NIH Regenerative Medicine Innovation Project) as well as the financial sector, where this is projected to be a $39B market by 2023 (representing 32% growth from 2016 market value).</p>
    
                        <p>The need is rooted in the many individuals impacted by a myriad of conditions ranging from genetic diseases to heart attacks to age-related functional decline. In many cases, the tissue damage can be both permanent and progressive, worsening with time. The lack of cures or even effective therapeutics for many diseases leaves a large pool of unmet need. In cases where organ transplantation is the best or only option, the gap is even greater. Patients are faced with organ shortages, invasive surgeries, lifelong management, and rejection potential.  </p>
                            
                        <p>The growth stems from revolutionary advances in biology and technology which permit a personalized approach to tissue regeneration or replacement. This is interdisciplinary by necessity as it represents a synergy between tissue-mimicking synthetic biomaterials, adult stem cell technology, and gene editing. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Our Unique Position</h3>
                        <p>This field depends on strong collaboration between bioengineers and biologists in order to develop living materials for patient intervention. BioFrontiers not only has current faculty with fruitful, years-long collaborations in this area but is actively adding faculty with regenerative medicine research programs.  We have three leaders in the production of biosynthetic materials in Kristi, Jason, and Stephanie and aim to build on their core in the next year with another hire in this area.</p>
